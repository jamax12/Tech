            <p style="color: greenyellow; font-family:MathJax_AMS;font-size: 20px">Eldoret Hospital is a premier healthcare facility located in Eldoret, Kenya, dedicated to providing high-quality medical services to the community. With a team of skilled professionals and state-of-the-art equipment, the hospital ensures comprehensive patient care in various specialties.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>In the stillness of the night, we wait for those who dare to seek our help. At Eldoret Hospital, we deliver more than just healthcare; we offer a chance to escape the horrors that plague your body and mind. Our commitment to compassion is unwavering, but our methods are not always as comforting as they seem. For those who enter, there is no turning back. We promise relief… but sometimes, the price is far greater than expected.</p>

                <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                <p>Our vision is to become the last place of refuge for those whose suffering has no end. In Eldoret, we will be remembered not for our treatments, but for the fear we instill in the hearts of the brave souls who walk through our doors. We are not just healers; we are the keepers of the boundary between life and death. And in the silence of our halls, some find their salvation, while others… remain lost forever.</p>

                <h2>Our Services</h2>
                <p>At Eldoret Hospital, our services are designed to confront the darkest corners of human affliction, offering more than what you might expect — and perhaps, more than you can handle:</p>
